# UPGMA-Phylogenetic-tree
UPGMA is a basic implementation of the [UPGMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UPGMA) (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean) algorithm, one of many used in bioinformatics (phylogenetics) for constructing evolutionary trees. (The typical data set is a matrix of molecular comparisons between species.)

The algorithm does this by repeatedly joining the columns and rows of the most similar (lowest-value) entries in the table until a final tree is constructed.
